        "fullText": "Summer in Armenia can be demanding on any vehicle. To avoid unexpected breakdowns, it’s crucial to perform regular maintenance. Here are our top tips:\n\n1. **Check Your Coolant:** Your engine's cooling system works overtime in the heat. Ensure your coolant is at the correct level and is clean. We recommend a coolant flush every two years.\n2. **Inspect Your Tires:** Hot asphalt increases tire pressure. Check your tire pressure in the morning before driving and ensure it matches your vehicle's recommended PSI. Don't forget to inspect the tread for wear.\n3. **Test Your Battery:** High temperatures can accelerate battery degradation. Visit us for a free battery test to ensure it holds a charge properly.\n4. **Protect Your Interior:** Use a sunshade to protect your dashboard from cracking and to keep the cabin temperature down.\n\nFollowing these simple steps can save you from costly repairs and keep you safe on the road all summer long."
